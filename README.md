**Overview of Melodia.** Our method consists of two main stages: (1) Partial DDIM Inversion with Attention Repository that stores self-attention features for structure preservation, and (2) Reverse Process with Attention-based Structure Retention (ASR) that manipulates self-attention maps during denoising to achieve music editing while maintaining the original temporal structure.
